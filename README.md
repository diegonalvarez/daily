# Daily's

An app to notify your daily in a specific hipchat room.

##Â Considerations

1. The daily will use the date of the day.
2. Only can add two messages for day for app_key, this purpose is avoid spam

### Using the API

To use any of the next calls is necesary that you get your app_key from Hipchat.

#### Adding a message

To add a new message is necesary that set two variables:

1. app_key
2. text

```

#### Getting the messages that will be published today
